# Conclusion

The exercise [How to a Build Bioconductor Package with RStudio](http://bioconductor.org/developers/how-to/buildingPackagesForBioc/) may also be helpful.

Remember that every \[*Bioconductor*\]\[\] package goes through a formal review process and may still receive technical feedback from the assigned \[*Bioconductor* reviewer\]\[reviewer-list\].

An overview of the submission process may be found in the [previous section](#subintro) and a package may be submitted to the \[GitHub package submission repository\]\[tracker\].

Thank you for reading these guidelines, and welcome to the \[*Bioconductor*\]\[\] community of users and developers!
