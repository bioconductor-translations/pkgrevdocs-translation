## 簡介

[*Bioconductor*](https://bioconductor.org) 是一個推廣 “高質量”，“完整文件庫” 和 “可互相操作” 軟件的計畫． These guidelines help to achieve this objective; they are not meant to put undue burden on package authors, and authors having difficultly satisfying guidelines should seek advice on the [bioc-devel](https://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/bioc-devel) mailing list.

Package maintainers are urged to follow these guidelines as closely as possible when developing [*Bioconductor*](https://bioconductor.org) packages.

General instructions for producing R packages can be found in the [Writing R Extensions](https://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/R-exts.html) manual, available from within <i class="fab fa-r-project"></i>
(`RShowDoc("R-exts")`) or on the [R website](http://cran.fhcrc.org/manuals.html).

Remember these are the minimum requirements for package acceptance and the package will still be subject to other guidelines below and a formal technical review by trained [*Bioconductor* package reviewer](https://bioconductor.org/about/package-reviewers/) .
